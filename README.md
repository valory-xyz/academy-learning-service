# Cryptocurrency Analysis and Forecasting Project

## Why We Created This Project

The Cryptocurrency Analysis and Forecasting Project was developed to address the need for a more structured and analytical approach in the cryptocurrency investment landscape. With the volatility and rapid changes inherent in crypto markets, investors and analysts require robust tools and comprehensive data to make informed decisions. This project aims to fill that gap by offering detailed analyses, predictive insights, and strategic recommendations tailored to different investor profiles and risk tolerances.

## About The Project

This project is a comprehensive initiative that combines data collection, integration, and advanced analytics to provide deep insights into the cryptocurrency market. It uses a variety of data sources, including historical and real-time market data, social media sentiment, and regulatory changes across different geographies to build a holistic view of the market dynamics. By leveraging machine learning and statistical models, the project aims to forecast market trends and identify investment opportunities effectively.

## Problem Solved

Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously difficult to predict due to their speculative nature and susceptibility to external influences like media and regulatory news. Traditional investment analysis tools are often inadequate due to the lack of integration of diverse data sources and the rapid pace of market changes. This project solves these problems by:
- Integrating multiple data types and sources to provide a comprehensive dataset.
- Analyzing sentiment and regulatory impacts in real-time.
- Developing predictive models that can adapt to the fast-evolving market conditions.

## Achievements

Through the implementation of this project, we have developed a system that can:
- Collect and process large volumes of data in real-time.
- Analyze and interpret complex market sentiments and trends.
- Provide actionable insights and predictive analytics to guide investment strategies.
- Enhance investment decision-making with advanced data-driven models.

## How The End Result Will Look

The end result is a user-friendly interface displaying various analytical outputs and predictions, accessible via a web dashboard. Users can view categorized lists of cryptocurrencies (like long-run stable tokens, short-run volatile tokens, etc.), accompanied by buy or avoid recommendations based on predictive analytics. Additionally, the system updates these lists and recommendations in real-time as new data is processed.

## Run you own agent

### Get the code

1. Clone this repo:

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:valory-xyz/academy-learning-service.git
    ```

2. Create the virtual environment:

    ```
    cd academy-learning-service
    poetry shell
    poetry install
    ```

3. Sync packages:

    ```
    autonomy packages sync --update-packages
    ```

### Prepare the data

1. Prepare a keys.json file containing wallet address and the private key for each of the four agents.

    ```
    autonomy generate-key ethereum -n 4
    ```

2. Prepare a `ethereum_private_key.txt` file containing one of the private keys from `keys.json`. Ensure that there is no newline at the end.

3. Deploy two [Safes on Gnosis](https://app.safe.global/welcome) (it's free) and set your agent addresses as signers. Set the signature threshold to 1 out of 4 for one of them and and to 3 out of 4 for the other. This way we can use the single-signer one for testing without running all the agents, and leave the other safe for running the whole service.

4. Create a [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/) account and from your dashboard create a fork of Gnosis chain (virtual testnet).

5. From Tenderly, fund your agents and Safe with some xDAI and OLAS (`0xcE11e14225575945b8E6Dc0D4F2dD4C570f79d9f`).

6. Make a copy of the env file:

    ```
    cp sample.env .env
    ```

7. Fill in the required environment variables in .env. These variables are:
- `ALL_PARTICIPANTS`: a list of your agent addresses. This will vary depending on whether you are running a single agent (`run_agent.sh` script) or the whole 4-agent service (`run_service.sh`)
- `GNOSIS_LEDGER_RPC`: set it to your Tenderly fork Admin RPC.
- `COINGECKO_API_KEY`: you will need to get a free [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) API key.
- `TRANSFER_TARGET_ADDRESS`: any random address to send funds to, can be any of the agents for example.
- `SAFE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_SINGLE`: the 1 out of 4 agents Safe address.
- `SAFE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: the 3 out of 4 Safe address.


### Run a single agent locally

1. Verify that `ALL_PARTICIPANTS` in `.env` contains only 1 address.

2. Run the agent:

    ```
    bash run_agent.sh
    ```

### Run the service (4 agents) via Docker Compose deployment

1. Verify that `ALL_PARTICIPANTS` in `.env` contains 4 address.

2. Check that Docker is running:

    ```
    docker
    ```

3. Run the service:

    ```
    bash run_service.sh
    ```

4. Look at the service logs for one of the agents (on another terminal):

    ```
    docker logs -f crypto_insight_service
    ```
